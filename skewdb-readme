# Abstract

GC skew denotes the relative excess of G nucleotides over C nucleotides on
the leading versus the lagging replication strand of eubacteria.  While the
effect is small, typically around 2.5%, it is robust and pervasive.  GC skew
and the analogous TA skew are a localized deviation from Chargaff's second
parity rule, which states that G and C, and T and A occur with (mostly)
equalfrequency even within a strand.  Most bacteria also show the analogous
TA skew.  

Different phyla show different kinds of skew and differing relations between
TA and GC skew.  This article introduces an open access database
(https://skewdb.org) of GC and 10 other skews for over 28,000 chromosomes
and plasmids.

Further details like codon bias, strand bias, strand lengths and taxonomic
data are also included.  The SkewDB database can be used to generate or
verify hypotheses.  Since the origins of both the second parity rule, as
well as GC skew itself, are not yet satisfactorily explained, such a
database may enhance our understanding of microbial DNA.

# Sources & Regeneration
As explained more fully in the preprint, all data is sourced from the NCBI
genome repository. No further data is required. This whole database can be
recreated using the open source Antonie software and the 'repro.sh' script
from https://github.com/berthubert/skewdb-articles/blob/master/repro.sh

# Contents
This distribution contains the following files:

 * gcskewdb.csv: one line per DNA sequence, containing a high-level description of skews and biases, plus phylogenetic data
 * skplot.csv: raw skew data for all DNA sequences, at 4096-nucleotide intervals
 * ...fit.csv: one file per DNA sequence, containing the data from skplot.csv, but also plotted fits of all the skews

For historical reasons some other fields are also present, these should not
be used until they are defined here.
