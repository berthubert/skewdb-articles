	abstract = {Chargaff's second parity rules for mononucleotides and oligonucleotides (CII mono and CII oligo rules) state that a sufficiently long ({\textgreater}100 kb) strand of genomic DNA that contains N copies of a mono- or oligonucleotide, also contains N copies of its reverse complementary mono- or oligonucleotide on the same strand. There is very strong support in the literature for the validity of the rules in coding and noncoding regions, especially for the CII mono rule. Because the experimental support for the CII oligo rule is much less complete, the present article, focusing on the special case of trinucleotides (triplets), examined several gigabases of genome sequences from a wide range of species and kingdoms including organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. I found that all genomes, with the only exception of certain mitochondria, complied with the CII triplet rule at a very high level of accuracy in coding and noncoding regions alike. Based on the growing evidence that genomes may contain up to millions of copies of interspersed repetitive elements, I propose in this article a quantitative formulation of the hypothesis that inversions and inverted transposition could be a major contributing if not dominant factor in the almost universal validity of the rules.},

	abstract = {The second parity rule states that, if there is no bias in mutation or selection, then within each strand of DNA complementary bases are present at approximately equal frequencies. In bacteria, however, there is commonly an excess of G (over C) and, to a lesser extent, T (over A) in the replicatory leading strand. The low G+C Firmicutes, such as Staphylococcus aureus, are unusual in displaying an excess of A over T on the leading strand. As mutation has been established as a major force in the generation of such skews across various bacterial taxa, this anomaly has been assumed to reflect unusual mutation biases in Firmicute genomes. Here we show that this is not the case and that mutation bias does not explain the atypical AT skew seen in S. aureus. First, recently arisen intergenic SNPs predict the classical replication-derived equilibrium enrichment of T relative to A, contrary to what is observed. Second, sites predicted to be under weak purifying selection display only weak AT skew. Third, AT skew is primarily associated with largely non-synonymous first and second codon sites and is seen with respect to their sense direction, not which replicating strand they lie on. The atypical AT skew we show to be a consequence of the strong bias for genes to be co-oriented with the replicating fork, coupled with the selective avoidance of both stop codons and costly amino acids, which tend to have T-rich codons. That intergenic sequence has more A than T, while at mutational equilibrium a preponderance of T is expected, points to a possible further unresolved selective source of skew.},

            Most living organisms rely on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to store their genetic information and perpetuate themselves. This biological information has been considered as the main target of evolution. However, here we show that symmetries and patterns in the dsDNA sequence can emerge from the physical peculiarities of the dsDNA molecule itself and the maximum entropy principle alone, rather than from biological or environmental evolutionary pressure. The randomness justifies the human codon biases and context-dependent mutation patterns in human populations. Thus, the DNA ‘exceptional symmetries,’ emerged from the randomness, have to be taken into account when looking for the DNA encoded information. Our results suggest that the double helix energy constraints and, more generally, the physical properties of the dsDNA are the hard drivers of the overall DNA sequence architecture, whereas the selective biological processes act as soft drivers, which only under extraordinary circumstances overtake the overall entropy content of the genome.},

A description of the methods and instruments is given. II. The pigment was prepared after the method of W i 11- statter and Stoll. III. The pigment follows Beer and Lambert’s law over a considerable range of concentrations in all the media studied. IV. The effect of photooxidation is studied. Spectroscopic measurements of the position of the first (main) absorption band are not influenced by photooxidation. An approximate absorption spectrum of the photooxidised product is given. V. The shifting of the band maxima In organic media follows, in general, Kundt’s ’’law”. The specific extinction is not altered in these media. The band moves ”bodily” through the spectrum, excepted in methyl, alcohol. In this medium the absorption band shows a kind of wing to the longer wavelengths. VI. A special method is described to prepare colloidal solutions of chlorophyll. The position of the band-maximum of the pigment in the colloidal \$tate is dependent upon the degree of dispersion of the pigment. Addition of bivalent ions to solutions of colloidal chlorophyll decreases the dispersion. With decreasing dispersion of the pigment, the band maximum shifts towards the longer wavelengths. VII. Dry chlorophyll has the same absorption maximum as the living plastid, but the pigment in this state is non-fluorescent. VIII. The system chlorophyll-lecithin-water is strongly fluorescent but shows a shift of too A to the shorter wavelengths. IX. The band maxima of several leaves are found to be practically identical. The maximum is found between 6800—6810 A. When leaves are ground the maximum shows no appreciable shift. On boiling the leaves, the maximum shifts to the shorter wavelengths. The maximum of the band of boiled leaves is found practically on the same place as the maximum of a system chlorophyll-lecithin-water. X. Plastids photographed in red light show that the absorbing complex is distributed inhomogeneously in the stroma of the chloroplastid. Some calculations have been made on the amount of chlorophyll in one single chloroplastid. The pigment cannot be present in one monomolecular layer around the surface of the plastid. XI. An attempt has been made to explain the structure of the plastid. Based on our experiments and the work of Noack (jo) and Mestre (45) the tentative conclusion Is reached that the ’’phyllochlorin” complex consists of a protein complex, lecithinoids and the four well known pigments.},

	abstract = {GC skew is a phenomenon observed in many bacterial genomes, wherein the two replication strands of the same chromosome contain different proportions of guanine and cytosine nucleotides. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon, which was first discovered in the mid-1990s, can be used today as an analysis tool for the 15,000+ complete bacterial genomes in NCBI’s Refseq library. In order to analyze all 15,000+ genomes, we introduce a new method, SkewIT (Skew Index Test), that calculates a single metric representing the degree of GC skew for a genome. Using this metric, we demonstrate how GC skew patterns are conserved within certain bacterial phyla, e.g. Firmicutes, but show different patterns in other phylogenetic groups such as Actinobacteria. We also discovered that outlier values of SkewIT highlight potential bacterial mis-assemblies. Using our newly defined metric, we identify multiple mis-assembled chromosomal sequences in previously published complete bacterial genomes. We provide a SkewIT web app

	abstract = {In theoretical physics, there exist two basic mathematical approaches, algebraic and geometrical methods, which, in most cases, are complementary. In the area of genome sequence analysis, however, algebraic approaches have been widely used, while geometrical approaches have been less explored for a long time. The Z-curve theory is a geometrical approach to genome analysis. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that represents a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. The Z-curve, therefore, contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. The analysis of a DNA sequence can then be performed through studying the corresponding Z-curve. The Z-curve method has found applications in a wide range of areas in the past two decades, including the identifications of protein-coding genes, replication origins, horizontally-transferred genomic islands, promoters, translational start sides and isochores, as well as studies on phylogenetics, genome visualization and comparative genomics. Here, we review the progress of Z-curve studies from aspects of both theory and applications in genome analysis.},
